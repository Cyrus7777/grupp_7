    "\n",
    "#### In this assignment, you will conduct an exploratory data analysis with visualizations on an Olympic Athletes dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to use this Notebook:\n",
    "-  Firstly, make sure you have completed [1. Setup](#1-setup).\n",
    "-  Secondly, complete [Task 1: Preprocessing](#task-1-preprocessing).\n",
    "-  Then, you can complete [Task 2: Summary Statistics](#task-2-summary-statistics) to [Task 6: Map Visualizations](#task-6-map-visualizations) in any order.\n",
    "-  Lastly, complete [Task 7: Submission](#task-7-submission).\n",
    "\n",
    "The various tasks contain Notebook cells with `TODO`s.\n",
    "- You need to complete all `TODO`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment files and folders.\n",
    "- The file `assignment.ipynb` is this Notebook.\n",
    "- The folder `data` contains:\n",
    "  - 4 `.csv` files with the data for this assignment.\n",
    "  - A `verify.pkl` file you can use to verify your solution in [Task 1.1 Data Loading, Data Fusion, Data Cleaning, and Feature Engineering](#task-11-data-loading-data-fusion-data-cleaning-and-feature-engineering).\n",
    "- The folder `figures` contains:\n",
    "  - 19 `.png` figures you can use to verify your solutions to the visualization tasks in [Task 3: Distribution Visualizations](#task-3-distribution-visualizations) to [Task 6: Map Visualizations](#task-6-map-visualizations).\n",
    "  - Your visualizations need to be similar, but not identical to, the sample visualizations.\n",
    "  - The sample visualizations are provided as an aid so that you know what to aim for.\n",
